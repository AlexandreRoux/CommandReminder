1. JOIN

    SELECT column_name(s)
    FROM table1
    INNER JOIN table2
    ON table1.column_name=table2.column_name;

    SELECT column_name(s)
    FROM table1
    JOIN table2
    ON table1.column_name=table2.column_name;

    PS! INNER JOIN is the same as JOIN.

2. LIKE

    SELECT * FROM Customers
    WHERE City LIKE 's%';

    SELECT * FROM Customers
    WHERE City LIKE '%s';

    SELECT * FROM Customers
    WHERE Country LIKE '%land%';
