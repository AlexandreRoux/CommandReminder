1. Check if handshake was captured
> ssl.handshake.type eq 16 and ip.addr eq vServer_IP

2. Check TCP bad packet
tcp.analysis.flags

The default Wireshark installation has a coloring rule named "Bad TCP" which uses red text on a black background. 
This coloring rule matches the condition "tcp.analysis.flags".

3. Filter out the time delay
((tcp.time_delta > .3 ) && (tcp.flags.fin == 0)) && (tcp.flags.reset == 0)
