+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


1. ShareFile Library
Load the ShareFile Library (dlls) into your environment and allow you to utilize them.

Shell > Add-PSSnapin ShareFile
------------------------------

2. ShareFile Authentication

Shell > New-SfClient
This command will call a web pop which will allow you to login into ShareFIle using your standard credentials.  
The request generates oAuth and session tokens which are then passed back into PowerShell where they need to be stored 
for further requests.

Option a. Shell > $sfLogin = New-SfClient
This will temporarily store the credentials as long as you have your PowerShell environment active.

Option b. Shell > New-SfClient –Name "c:\tmp\sflogin.sfps"
This will temporarily store the credentials as long as you have your PowerShell environment active.

Shell > $sfLogin = Get-SfClient –Name "c:\tmp\sflogin.sfps"
This will use the file recently created to login information (allows you to run scripts uninterrupted once you pass through 
the initial authentication)
------------------------------

3. Executing Requests
Shell > $sfItems = Send-SFRequest –Client $sfLogin –Method GET –Entity Items
This request will retrieve all the items the user has access to.  Items can include files, folders, notes and links.  
The result set will be saved to the variable $sfItems which can be used later.

-Client – this is the variable you saved your oAuth Login token to, in our case we are saving it to $sfLogin

-Method – this is the HTTP verb you are using for this request. The available verbs are

GET – Gets an entity
POST – Create an entity
PATCH – Update an entity
DELETE – Deletes an entity

-Entity – This is the actual API Object we are working with, you can find a full list of API entities at api.sharefile.com
